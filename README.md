## Problem Statement :
People in rural areas face many difficulties in getting timely and accurate healthcare because they live far from medical facilities, there aren't enough doctors, and the infrastructure is lacking. These problems often cause delays in diagnosing and treating health issues, which can lead to worse outcomes. Additionally, the lack of basic tools to check health and low awareness about health make it hard for people to understand how serious their symptoms are and when they should get help.
